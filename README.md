# PowerShellPodcastSync
A simple PowerShell script to add speakers from the PowerShell Podcast to a twitter.

There are two Github actions:
1. One runs the PowerShell script to add speakers to the Twitter List
2. The second checks the speaker list and see's if they have any Mastadon info and tries to add them to a Mastadon list
